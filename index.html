<h2>why we need to build a safety net into society</h2>
<p>most of us think what separates fortunate and unfortunate, rich and poor, happy and unhappy and so on is time, effort, dedication and hard work. this is partly true, however it mostly comes down to one thing: luck. 
naturally, economies experience booms and busts. we can be resilient to these swings (<a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility" target="_blank">sometimes even antifragile)</a>, but not everyone in society will be able to recover. all it could take for a downturn to lead to ruin is the fine margin between person one and person two in the chart below. however this also means that when person one reaches the point of no return, all it would take to ensure long term ruin is avoided would be a small push that prevents that person from going over the edge.</p>

<p>if we pay attention to <a href="https://mathinvestor.org/2013/10/two-tales-of-the-kelly-formula/" target="_blank">the theory of gambler's ruin</a>, we might conclude that this problem could be avoided by simply finding the correct bet size for each person, to ensure they never go bust. however besides the fact that this is probably impossible in the real world, it is also not an optimal strategy for society, where pooling resources is allowed. for an indidividual it makes sense to ensure personal safety, but the price that is paid for this is reduced risk taking via (1) lower bet sizes and (2) more selective participation in games. (2) is a fallacy, because it is based on the perceived odds of winning a game, rather than actual odds (i.e. long shots may still be worth betting on, but may not be perceived as such).</p>
<p>a safety net would ensure that the individual's chances of success or failure are no longer factors in optimal risk taking. we could have made breakthrough discoveries such as penicillin or x-rays much sooner if we had a higher tolerance for failure.
